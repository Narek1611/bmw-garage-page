    <div class="historyText">The BMW E30 is the second generation of BMW 3 Series,
         which was produced from 1982 to 1994 and replaced the E21 3 Series. 
         The model range included 2-door sedan and convertible body styles,[4][5] as well as being
          the first 3 Series to be produced in 4-door sedan and wagon/estate body styles. 
          It was powered by four-cylinder petrol, six-cylinder petrol and six-cylinder diesel engines, 
          the latter a first for the 3 Series. The E30 325iX model was the first BMW to have all-wheel drive.

        The first BMW M3 model was built on the E30 platform and was powered by the high-revving BMW S14 four-cylinder petrol engine, 
        which produced 175 kW (235 bhp) in its final iteration.[6] The BMW Z1 roadster was also based on the E30 platform. 
        Following the launch of the E36 3 Series in 1990, the E30 began to be phased out.</div>
